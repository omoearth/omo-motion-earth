      Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
      object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E
      OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF
      YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION.
      THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE
      THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT
      THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO
      LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO
      PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
      DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE

      ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>

    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      <br />In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled
      to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
      state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the
      place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint
      is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings
      available as legal recourses.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically
      process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be
      handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
      format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
      controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
      content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
      website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
      programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether
      the address line of the browser switches from „http://“ to „https://“ and
      also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot
      be read by third parties.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
      right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data,
      their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of
      your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or
      eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other
      questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
      time at the address provided in section „Information Required by Law.“
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the
      processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact
      us at any time at the address provided in section „Information Required by
      Law.“ The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
      following cases:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
        archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
        During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
        to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful
        manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing
        of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
        exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
        demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
        of its eradication.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your
        rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
        long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
        right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data –
      with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to
      your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
      protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
      important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member
      state of the EU.
    </p>
    <br />

    <br />

      of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your
      agreement (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this has been requested.

    <h2>Our social media appearances</h2>
    <br />
    <h4>Data processing through social networks</h4>
    <br />
    <p>
      We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual
      social networks we use can be found below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social networks such as Facebook, Google+ etc. can generally analyse your
      user behaviour comprehensively if you visit their website or a website
      with integrated social media content (e.g. like buttons or banner ads).
      When you visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant
      processing operations are triggered. In detail:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social
      media page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit
      to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may
      also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with
      the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected,
      for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media
      portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests
      are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and
      outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the
      social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device
      you are logged in to or have logged in to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the
      social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing
      operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social
      media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy
      of the respective social media portals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>Legal basis</strong>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on
      the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6
      (1) lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks
      may be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of
      the social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a)
      GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>Responsibility and assertion of rights</strong>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together
      with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the
      data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in
      principle protect your rights (information, correction, deletion,
      limitation of processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as
      well as vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g.
      Facebook).
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media
      portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing
      operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the
      company policy of the respective provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>Storage time</strong>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be
      deleted from our systems as soon as the purpose for their storage lapses,
      you ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the
      purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored cookies remain on your device
      until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular,
      retention periods - remain unaffected.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored
      by the social network operators for their own purposes. For details,
      please contact the social network operators directly (e.g. in their
      privacy policy, see below).
