      IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT. E
      OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF
      YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION.
      THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE
      THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT
      THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO
      LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO
      PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
      DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE
      OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
    <p>
      In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log
      a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state
      where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place
      where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in
      effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings
      available as legal recourses.
    </p>
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically
      process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be
      handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
      format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
      controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
    </p>
    <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>
      For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
      content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
      website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
      programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether
      the address line of the browser switches from „http://“ to „https://“ and
      also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot
      be read by third parties.
    </p>
    <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
    <p>
      Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
      right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data,
      their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of
      your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or
      eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other
      questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
      time at the address provided in section „Information Required by Law.“
    </p>
    <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
    <p>

      processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact
      us at any time at the address provided in section „Information Required by
      Law.“ The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
      following cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
        archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
        During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
        to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful
        manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing
        of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
        exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
        demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
        of its eradication.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your
        rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
        long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
        right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data –
      with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to
      your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
      protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
      important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member
      state of the EU.
    </p>
    <h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
    <p>
      We herewith object to the use of contact information published in
      conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in section

      of the requests addressed to us (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your

      provisions – in particular retention periods.

      without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if
      your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is

      processing is based on your consent (Article 6 (1) a GDPR) and/or on our
      legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate
      interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us.

      request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose

      - remain unaffected.
